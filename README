1.  What is this?

    'tNote' is a bash script for people who prefer maintaining simple text-notes
    from the command-line.

    The code is based on 'cheat' by James Hendrie


2.  Install / Uninstall

    To install this script, as root, run 'make install' from inside the top
    directory to which you've downloaded/extracted the program; it should be the
    same directory where you found this README file.

    To uninstall the program, as root and from that same directory (or whichever
    directory contains the Makefile), run 'make uninstall'.


3.  How do I use it?

    Using this script is straightforward enough, in the typical UNIX/Linux
    fashion:

    tnote [OPTION] FILE

    Options:
    - Search:
        -s or --search:         Search for keyword(s) in file names and inside file text
        -st or --searchtitle:   Search for keyword(s) in file names
        -sc or --searchcontent: Search for keyword(s) inside file text
        -l or -- list:          List all notes
    - Add and edit:
        -a or --add:            Add a text file to the tnote note directory
        -e or --edit:           Edit a tnote note, using the default editor
    - Misc:
        -h or --help:           Display the help
        -v or --version:        List version and author info


    Examples:
        tnote foo:              List all notes with 'foo' in the filename; if there
                                is only one result, it will be displayed
        tnote -s foo:           Search all notes with 'foo' in the title or content
        tnote -st bar:          Search all notes with 'bar' in the filename
        tnote -sc foo bar:      Search all notes with 'foo' or 'bar' in the content
        tnote -a foo:           Create a note with the title 'foo'


    There are a few useful variables for people who use this script a lot:
    DEFAULT_TNOTE_DIR, TNOTEPATH, and TNOTE_TEXT_VIEWER.

    DEFAULT_TNOTE_DIR is the directory in which tnote notes are stored by
    default. This is set to $HOME/.tnote if left unspecified by the user.

    TNOTEPATH is similar to the PATH variable, except it's used for tnote
    notes.  If you're referencing tnote sheets from multiple directories,
    you'll want to make use of this environment variable.  If this variable is
    not set by the user, it's populated by DEFAULT_TNOTE_DIR.  If the user does
    set this variable, it's up to them to include every directory in which tnote
    sheets are kept, as DEFAULT_TNOTE_DIR is not automatically added to the
    TNOTEPATH variable.

    TNOTE_TEXT_VIEWER is the program used to view the normal tnote sheets.  It's
    assumed to accept text from stdin ('cat' and 'less' are good options).
    'cat' is used by default.
